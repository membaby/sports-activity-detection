# Sports Activity Detection

## Problem Statement

In todayâ€™s era of data-driven decision-making, the ability to identify patterns, group similar entities, and extract insights from large datasets has become in-dispensable across various domains. Clustering, a fundamental technique in unsupervised machine learning, plays a key role in organizing data into mean-ingful groups based on similarities. The objective of this assignment is to help students understand how K-Means and Normalized Cut algorithms can be used for the detection of daily and sports activities captured using motion sensors.
